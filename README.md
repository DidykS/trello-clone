In this project, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So far, it works well only on Desktop devices.
This project focuses mostly on JavaScript, I use HTML & CSS only to create a beautiful view of my project. But they are also important in this project.

_The idea of the design was taken from the trello.com website._
